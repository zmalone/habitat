# Promote the contents of the release channel into the channel
# specified by the argument.
#
# This is to support the usecase of promoting packages from the
# release channel to `builder-live`, and then from `builder-live` to
# `stable`.
#
# In an ideal world, both channels would be arguments, but since we
# don't yet have an API that allows us to ask for only the latest
# packages for each target platform in a given channel, that second
# promotion from `builder-live` to `stable` would get larger and
# larger as time goes on.
#
# Instead, we'll always promote from the release channel, since the
# release pipeline completely controls its lifecycle from creation to
# destruction. We know that all packages in there should be promoted.
#
# In the future, though, we'll want to just promote from
# `builder-live` into `stable`. (Ultimately, of course, we'll want to
# dispense with this `builder-live` stuff altogether because we'll
# have enough additional testing and usage that we *know* it'll be
# perfectly safe to promote a set of release candidates directly to
# `stable`... it'll happen!)
#
# Assumes that the only contents of the channel are going to be
# Habitat Supervisor release artifacts
#
# TODO: It'd be nice to have this be an API function.

# We explicitly promote the Supervisor packages last. Initially, this

# environment. That bug has since been fixed, but promoting the
# supervisors last provides some degree of determinism in how the

#
# Our A2 team is using this for some automation purposes right now,
# for instance. Once Builder has notifications and / or we can
# atomically promote a set of packages, we can simplify all this to
# just promote everything at once. Until that time, however, please
# leave this arrangement "as is".
